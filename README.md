Features, Requirements and Test Cases management as Code

The idea of this project is to keep content for Feature, Requirements and Test Cases in a WYSIWYG manner that simplifies a lot editing and can be generated automatically (for ex in project Pipelines). Another major goals in keeping those items
as code is easy versioning of them together with the code using git.
